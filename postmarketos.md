## Method 6: postmarketOS
i have no idea what you are supposed to do
1. grab installer https://postmarketos.org/install/
2. use install guide https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Installation
3. use device guide if needed https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Devices


## postmarketOS
1. Only on ARM Chromebooks such as `gru`, `kukai`, `oak`, `trogdor`, `veyron`, `corsola`, `cherry`, `asurada`, and `cherry`. (HOWEVER Gerneric x86-64 EFI and `Google Chromebooks with x64 CPU` builds exist and can be used with Method 1/Full ROM).
2. Pretty mediocore install guide (FROM pmOS themselves!!!)
